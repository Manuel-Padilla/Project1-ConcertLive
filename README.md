Project 1 - Concert Live

<h1>Concert Live</h1>

Through our mutual love for music we have created a service with the power of the SeatGeek and Napster APIs to combine music searches with cheap ticket prices. 
For this app we are using Napsterâ€™s API to give the user a 30 second song preview while the SeatGeek API automatically provides a link to review ticket prices. 
For design we used the Materialize library to successfully render the HTML elements on the screen. 
After the user inputs their artist choice two Ajax calls are triggered to return a list of music and a URL to purchase tickets.
